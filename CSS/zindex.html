     <p>Sunflowers are useful plants with large flower heads, or blooms. They are named for the way they turn their blooms from east to west to follow the Sun. Sunflowers were first grown in North and South America. Today they are also grown in other parts of the world, including Europe and Asia. Sunflowers are giants among flowers.
