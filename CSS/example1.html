        They truly valued nature which reflects in their works even today. Essentially, nature is everything we are surrounded by like the water we drink, the air we breathe, the sun we soak in,
        the birds we hear chirping, the moon we gaze at and more. Above all, it is rich and vibrant and consists of both <span>living </span> non-living things. Therefore, people of the modern age should
